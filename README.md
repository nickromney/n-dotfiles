# n-dotfiles

An opinionated dotfiles setup designed to:

- work on Mac OS X with brew
- work on Ubuntu (particularly in dev containers and for GitHub Actions)
- be extensible to add other package managers

## Design considerations

- I work on Mac OS X
- I'm trying to move to use dev containers
- I'm a DevOps Engineer by recent training, so like idempotent code

I looked at [nix flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/flakes) but although I'm often tweaking my configuration, I don't need to set up whole new machines enough to warrant it. This [blog](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/11/11/notes-on-nix-flakes/) from Julia Evans convinced me away from it.

## Quick Start

### Fresh macOS Installation

For a brand new Mac, use the bootstrap script:

```bash
# Create directory structure and clone
mkdir -p ~/Developer/personal
cd ~/Developer/personal
git clone https://github.com/nickromney/n-dotfiles.git
cd n-dotfiles

# Run bootstrap to install essential tools
./bootstrap.sh

# Then continue with regular installation
./install.sh -d        # Dry run to preview
./install.sh           # Install base tools
./install.sh -s        # Stow configurations
```

### Existing System

If you already have Homebrew and basic tools:

```bash
# Clone and enter directory
git clone https://github.com/nickromney/n-dotfiles.git ~/n-dotfiles
cd ~/n-dotfiles

# Install common Mac tools (recommended starting point)
make common install

# Or install my personal setup (includes VSCode extensions)
make personal stow

# Or just install VSCode and extensions
make focus-vscode
```

## Using the Makefile

The Makefile provides convenient targets for different configurations:

```bash
# Main targets
make common       # Essential Mac tools (shared + host/common)
make personal     # My personal machine setup
make work         # Work machine setup

# Focus targets (specific tool categories)
make focus-vscode     # VSCode and extensions
make focus-devops     # DevOps tools
make focus-neovim     # Neovim and plugins

# Actions (combine with targets)
make personal install  # Install packages only
make personal update   # Update existing packages
make personal stow     # Install and create symlinks

# VSCode for different editors
VSCODE_CLI=cursor make focus-vscode  # Install extensions for Cursor
```

## Features

- Automatically detects available package managers
- Skips unavailable package managers without failing
- Installs only tools that match available package managers
- Uses GNU Stow for configuration management
- Force mode (`-f`) to handle existing configurations

## Usage

### Package Installation and Configuration

```bash
# Install packages only
./install.sh

# Install packages and stow configurations
./install.sh -s

# Preview changes without making them
./install.sh -d -s

# Force stow to adopt existing files
./install.sh -s -f

# Update installed packages
./install.sh -u
```

### macOS System Configuration

Light-touch macOS configuration management:

```bash
# Show current system settings
./_macos/macos.sh

# Apply personal configuration
./_macos/macos.sh personal.yaml

# Dry run to preview changes
./_macos/macos.sh -d personal.yaml
```

See [_macos/README.md](_macos/README.md) for detailed macOS configuration options.

## 1Password Integration

This repository includes comprehensive 1Password integration for secure credential and configuration management.

### SSH Configuration Management

The `setup-ssh-from-1password.sh` script manages SSH configuration with security by default:

#### Default (Safe) Mode

```bash
# Download SSH config + public keys only (private keys stay in 1Password)
./setup-ssh-from-1password.sh

# Check what's available without downloading
./setup-ssh-from-1password.sh --dry-run
```

In safe mode:

- Downloads SSH config from 1Password (stored as Secure Note)
- Downloads **public keys only** for reference
- Private keys remain in 1Password
- Uses 1Password SSH Agent for authentication

#### Unsafe Mode (When 1Password SSH Agent Isn't Available)

```bash
# Download private keys (requires explicit confirmation)
./setup-ssh-from-1password.sh --unsafe
```

Use unsafe mode when:

- 1Password SSH Agent cannot be installed in your environment
- You're using a restricted system without agent support
- You need keys for backup/migration purposes

### Git Configuration Management

The `setup-gitconfig-from-1password.sh` script manages work-specific Git configurations:

```bash
# Download work Git config from 1Password
./setup-gitconfig-from-1password.sh

# Check availability without downloading
./setup-gitconfig-from-1password.sh --dry-run
```

This allows you to:

- Store work-specific Git config in 1Password
- Automatically apply it to `~/Developer/work/.gitconfig_include`
- Keep work email and GitHub Enterprise settings secure
- Use `includeIf` in main `.gitconfig` for automatic switching

### AWS Credentials Helper

The `aws/.aws/aws-1password` script provides on-demand AWS credential fetching:

```bash
# Configure AWS CLI to use 1Password
aws configure set credential_process "$HOME/.aws/aws-1password --username default"

# For different profiles
aws configure set credential_process "$HOME/.aws/aws-1password --username tfcli" --profile terraform
```

This approach:

- Never stores AWS credentials on disk
- Fetches credentials from 1Password when needed
- Works seamlessly with AWS CLI and SDKs
- Supports multiple AWS accounts/profiles

### Setting Up 1Password Items

#### SSH Keys

1. Open 1Password and create new item → SSH Key
2. Name it exactly as expected by the script:
   - `github_personal_authentication`
   - `github_personal_signing`
   - `aws_work_2024_client_1`
   - `github_work_2025_client_1`
3. Paste your private key
4. Save to "Private" vault (or adjust `VAULT` in script)

#### SSH Config

1. Create new item → Secure Note
2. Name it: `SSH Config`
3. Paste your complete SSH configuration
4. Save to "Private" vault

#### Git Config

1. Create new item → Secure Note
2. Name it: `work .gitconfig_include`
3. Add your work-specific Git configuration:

   ```ini
   [url "github-work:OrgName/"]
     insteadOf = git@github.com:OrgName/
   [user]
     email = work@company.com
   ```

4. Save to "Private" vault

#### AWS Credentials

1. Create new item → API Credential (or custom item)
2. Name it based on your mapping (e.g., `AWSCredsUsernameDefault`)
3. Add fields:
   - `ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS Access Key ID
   - `SECRET_KEY`: Your AWS Secret Access Key
4. Save to "CLI" vault (or adjust in script)

### Security Benefits

- **No secrets in version control**: All sensitive data stays in 1Password
- **Encrypted at rest**: 1Password handles all encryption
- **Audit trail**: 1Password logs all access to credentials
- **Easy rotation**: Update credentials in one place
- **Team sharing**: Safely share vaults with team members
- **MFA protection**: Additional security with 1Password's MFA

  type: tap
  check_command: "brew tap | grep -q '^noahgorstein/tap$'"
  install_args: []
```

### Install a Homebrew cask application

```yaml
kitty:
  manager: brew
  type: cask
  check_command: 'brew list --cask kitty >/dev/null 2>&1 || [ -d "/Applications/kitty.app" ] || which kitty >/dev/null 2>&1'
  install_args: []
```

### Install a Homebrew package

```yaml
bat:
  manager: brew
  type: package
  check_command: "bat --version"
  install_args: []
```

### Install a tool via arkade

```yaml
atuin:
  manager: arkade
  type: get
  check_command: "test -f $HOME/.arkade/bin/atuin"
  install_args: []
```

### Install a Python tool via uv

```yaml
posting:
  manager: uv
  type: tool
  check_command: "which posting >/dev/null 2>&1"
  install_args: ["--python", "3.12"]
```

### Install VSCode extensions

```yaml
prettier-vscode:
  manager: code
  type: extension
  extension_id: esbenp.prettier-vscode
  check_command: "code --list-extensions | grep -q esbenp.prettier-vscode"
  description: "Code formatter"
  documentation_url: "https://prettier.io/"
  category: vscode-extension
```

Each tool entry requires:

```yaml
manager: Package manager to use (brew/arkade/uv/cargo/apt/code)
type: Installation method specific to the manager
check_command: Command to verify installation
install_args: Additional installation arguments (optional)

```bash
# Default: uses 'code' CLI
make focus-vscode

# For Cursor editor
VSCODE_CLI=cursor make focus-vscode

# For VSCodium
VSCODE_CLI=vscodium make focus-vscode
```

## Testing

The repository includes a comprehensive test suite using BATS (Bash Automated Testing System):

```bash
# Install BATS (required for testing)
brew install bats-core  # macOS
sudo apt-get install bats  # Ubuntu/Debian

# Run all tests
./_test/run_tests.sh

# Run tests with specific filter
cd _test && bats install.bats --filter "install_tool"
```

The test suite includes:

- Unit tests for all utility functions
- Integration tests for package manager detection
- Installation tests for each package manager type
- macOS configuration tests with defaults mocking
- Mocking framework to simulate external commands
- 65+ comprehensive tests covering all major functionality

### Handling `errexit` in Shell Scripts

The `install.sh` script uses `set -euo pipefail` for strict error handling, which is a best practice for production scripts. However, this can cause issues in certain scenarios:

1. **Testing**: When functions are sourced in test environments, commands that normally fail (like checking for non-existent commands) will cause the entire function to exit.

2. **Information Gathering**: Functions that check system state need to handle failures gracefully without exiting.

The script handles this by temporarily disabling `errexit` in functions that need to tolerate failures:

```bash
get_available_managers() {
  # Save current errexit setting and disable it
  local old_errexit
  old_errexit=$(set +o | grep errexit)
  set +e
  
  # ... function body that may have failing commands ...
  
  # Restore errexit setting before returning
  eval "$old_errexit"
  return 0
}
```

This pattern ensures:

- The function can complete even if some commands fail
- The original shell options are preserved
- The script maintains strict error handling elsewhere
